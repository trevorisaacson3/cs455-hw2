## Scalable Server Design: Using Thread Pools & Micro Batching to Manage and Load Active Network Connections

> As part of this assignment you will be developing a server to handle network traffic by designing and building your own thread pool. This thread pool will have a configurable number of threads that will be used to perform tasks relating to network communications. Specifically, you will use this thread pool to manage all tasks relating to network communications. This includes:
    Managing incoming network connections
    Receiving data over these network connections
    Organizing data into batches to improve performance
    Sending data over any of these links
